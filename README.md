# chut
MUTE is a simple shell executable to mut or increase/decrease the system audio volume on Mac OS X.

USAGE chut [][-][--][+][++]
      no arg will mute (default)
      [-][+] [--][++] to decrease or increase the volume
      [+++] to set to the maximum
      [-h][--help] display this message

NOTE sys sets volume as float (0-10/0.1) but outputs int (0-100/14)

Handy, at least for me !
